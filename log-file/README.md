# MapReduce for Log File

The data set we're using is an anonymized Web server log file from a public relations company whose clients were DVD distributors. The log file is in the udacity_training/data directory, and it's currently compressed using GnuZip. So you'll need to decompress it and then put it in HDFS. If you take a look at the file, you'll see that each line represents a hit to the Web server. It includes the IP address which accessed the site, the date and time of the access, and the name of the page which was visited.


## Data 

The logfile is in [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format)

Where:

%h is the IP address of the client
%l is identity of the client, or "-" if it's unavailable
%u is username of the client, or "-" if it's unavailable
%t is the time that the server finished processing the request. The format is [day/month/year:hour:minute:second zone]
%r is the request line from the client is given (in double quotes). It contains the method, path, query-string, and protocol or the request.
%>s is the status code that the server sends back to the client. You will see see mostly status codes 200 (OK - The request has succeeded), 304 (Not Modified) and 404 (Not Found). See more information on status codes in W3C.org
%b is the size of the object returned to the client, in bytes. It will be "-" in case of status code 304.
